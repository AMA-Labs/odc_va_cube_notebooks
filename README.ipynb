    "\n",
    "The ODC VA Cube Notebooks are Jupyter Notebooks for the Virginia Open Data Cube project.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an overview of the available notebooks, see the [Notebooks Overview](https://github.com/jcrattz/odc_va_cube_notebooks/blob/master/docs/notebooks_overview.md) document.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "First follow the instructions in the [Docker Installation Guide](https://github.com/ceos-seo/data_cube_ui/blob/master/docs/docker_install.md) if you do not have Docker installed yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions in the [Open Data Cube Database Installation Guide](https://github.com/ceos-seo/data_cube_ui/blob/master/docs/odc_db_setup.md) to setup the Open Data Cube (ODC) database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions in the [Operation Manual](docs/notebooks_operation_manual.md) to set up and operate the Jupyter Notebook environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notebooks - generally prefixed with `_GEE` - make use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) data. You must be registered as an Earth Engine developer. If not, you may submit an [application to Google](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/). These notebooks make use of the CEOS ODC-GEE project which can be found here: [https://github.com/ceos-seo/odc-gee](https://github.com/ceos-seo/odc-gee).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need [GEE service account credentials](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/service_account) - specifically the private key JSON file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding New GEE Datasets as ODC Products\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a GEE dataset from the [Earth Engine Data Catalog[(https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/), a new product must be created using the `new_product` command. Format: `new_product --asset <asset_id> <product_name.yaml>` where the `asset_id` is provided in the \"Earth Engine Snippet\" string on the dataset's page on the catalog and `product_name.yaml` is the path to the output YAML file containing the ODC product definition. For example, to index [Landsat 8 Level 2 Collection 2 Tier 1](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_LC08_C02_T1_L2?hl=en) data: `new_product --asset LANDSAT/LC08/C02/T1_L2 ls8_l2_c2_gee.yaml`. The full process is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the `new_product` command to create the product definition.\n",
    "2. Reformat the product definition to match a standard format, such as [this one](https://github.com/ceos-seo/odc_manual_indexer/blob/develop/prod_defs/Landsat/collection_2/ls8_l2_c2.yaml).\n",
    "3. Change the `aliases` field for the measurements as desired. Do NOT change the `name` field of any measurement - creating the product will fail if the `name` fields are changed.\n",
    "4. Run `datacube product add <path-to-product-definition-file>` to add the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, you will need to add a `storage` section with `crs` and `resolution` entries to avoid having to specify the `output_crs` and `resolution` each time data is loaded from the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "After adding the product, it is a **non-indexed GEE product**. It must be loaded using a modified version of the `datacube.Datacube` class, as will be shown later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the data can be indexed using the `index_gee` command, making it an **indexed GEE product**, but **this is deprecated**. Format: `index_gee --asset <asset_id> --product <product_name> [--latitude (lat1, lat2) --longitude (lon1, lon2) --time (YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM-DD) --region <region_name>]` (for information on the optional arguments and others not listed here, run `index_gee --help`). For example, to index [Landsat 8 Level 2 Collection 2 Tier 1](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_LC08_C02_T1_L2?hl=en) data for the United States: `index_gee --asset LANDSAT/LC08/C02/T1_L2 --product <product_name> --latitude (25.3168, 49.4885) --longitude (-125.2052, -66.6657)`. Data for these products can be loaded by the normal `datacube.Datacube` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using GEE vs non-GEE Data\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "To load data from non-GEE products, use the `datacube.Datacube` class as always:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from datacube import Datacube\n",
    "dc = datacube.Datacube()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To load data from GEE products, use the `odc_gee.earthengine.Datacube` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from odc_gee.earthengine import Datacube as GEE_Datacube\n",
    "dc = GEE_Datacube()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To load data from indexed GEE products (remember **this is deprecated**), use the `datacube.Datacube` class as shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GEE versus Alternative Datasources\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the benefits and penalties of loading data from Google Earth Engine through the ODC-GEE module instead of from other datasources such as S3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "1. Data does not need to be indexed before loading, which allows new datasets to be added and queried quickly, which allows faster prototyping. This also results in a much smaller ODC index database.\n",
    "2. There is no cost to loading data from GEE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Penalties:\n",
    "1. Data has a very low throughput - just a few MiB per second.\n",
    "2. (Advanced) Using `dask_chunks` in the `load()` call does not work as expected. Normally, loads specifying the `dask_chunks` parameters will not immediately load data - instead creating the plan to load data with Dask. Instead, the data immediately begins loading as if `dask_chunks` was not specified. This can be problematic for datasets that are larger than the amount of available memory. This problem does not occur when loading data using the normal `datacube.Datacube` class.\n"
